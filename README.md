# elibGrabber
Downloads rare books scans from some public libraries
------------------------

Actually, it's quickly written PHP console tool for downloading books scans from some public libraries.
It only gets files of the book and save them to a pointed directory.

Supports:
  - dlib.rsl.ru
  - elib.shpl.ru
  - elib.tomsk.ru
  
 Now it's pretty raw, ugly and written just for me, but it works.
 
 Usage:
 1. Point all parameters you need (currentMode, totalPages, bookId, startingPage).
 2. Run
 
   `php get.php`
